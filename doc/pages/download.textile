h2.  Installing Buildr

The easiest way to install Buildr is using the fabulous RubyGems package manager.  Of course, you will need either Ruby or JRuby, and we recommend upgrading to the most recent version of RubyGems.  If this sounds foreign to you, don't worry.  We'll show you how to install Buildr on Linux, OS X, Windows and JRuby in the "Getting Started guide":getting_started.html, we even provide automated installation scripts.

The *official Apache distribution* consists of the digitally signed binaries (gems) and source packages "available below":#binaries_and_source_code.  To install these binaries, you must first download them to disk and then install them using the @gem install@ command (or @rake install@ for a source distribution).

In addition, contributors to this project maintain a separate distribution over on "RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/projects/buildr.  Using this distribution, you're able to install Buildr directly from the remote gem repository and to automatically upgrade when a new release comes out.  The RubyForge distribution is *not* an official Apache distribution.

The source code is included in both source and binary distribution, the Gem distribution expands the source code into your local Gem repository. That's in addition to getting the source code directly from "SVN":http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/buildr or "GitHub":http://github.com/vic/buildr/tree/master.

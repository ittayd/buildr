h2.  Installing Buildr

The easiest way to install Buildr is using the fabulous RubyGems package manager.  Of course,
you will need either Ruby or JRuby, and we recommend a recent version of RubyGems and
if this sounds foreign to you, don't worry.  We'll show you how to install Buildr on Linux,
OS/X, Windows and JRuby in the "Getting Started guide":getting_started.html, we even provide
automated installation scripts.


h2.  Binaries and Source Code

At the moment we do not make offical Apache binary and source distributions.
Unofficial binary and source distributions are available form
"RubyForge":http://rubyforge.org/projects/buildr.

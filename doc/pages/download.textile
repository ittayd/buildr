h2.  Installing Buildr

The easiest way to install Buildr is using the fabulous RubyGems package
manager.  Of course, you will need either Ruby or JRuby, and we recommend a
recent version of RubyGems and if this sounds foreign to you, don't worry.
We'll show you how to install Buildr on Linux, OS/X, Windows and JRuby in the
"Getting Started guide":getting_started.html, we even provide automated
installation scripts.

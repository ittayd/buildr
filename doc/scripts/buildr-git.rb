Buildr official commit channel is Apache's svn repository, however some
developers may prefer to use git while working on several features and
merging other's changes.

This script will configure a buildr-git copy on so you can commit to svn.

Enter <-h> to see options, <-H> to see notes about configured aliases
and recommended workflow, or any other option.

ALIASES:

  Some git aliases have been created for developer convenience:

    git apache-fetch    # get changes from apache/trunk without merging them
                        # you can inspect what's happening on trunk without
                        # having to worry about merging conflicts.
                        # Inspect the remote branch with `git log apache/trunk`
                        # Or if you have a git-ui like `tig` you can use that.

    git apache-merge    # Merge already fetched changes on the current branch
                        # Use this command to get up to date with trunk changes
                        # you can always cherry-pick from the apache/trunk 
                        # branch.

    git apache-pull     # get apache-fetch && git apache-merge
   
    git apache-push     # Push to Apache's SVN. Only staged changes (those 
                        # recorded using `git commit`) will be sent to SVN. 
                        # You need not to be on the master branch.
                        # Actually you can work on a tiny-feature branch and
                        # commit directly from it. 
                        #
                        # VERY IMPORTANT: 
                        #
                        # Missing commits on Apache's SVN will be sent using
                        # your apache svn account. This means that you can
                        # make some commits on behalf of others (like patches
                        # comming from JIRA issues or casual contributors)
                        # Review the apache-push alias on .git/config if you 
                        # want to change login-name used for commit to SVN.
                        # 
                        # See the recommended workflow to avoid commiting 
                        # other developers' changes and the following section.

THE GITHUB MIRROR:

   Buildr has an unofficial git mirror on github, maintained by Victor: 

     http://github.com/vic/buildr

   Actually it's not Victor who manually updates it, he has a cron-job on his
   server, that only runs

     git synchronize 

   A command you also have configured on your .git/config file.

   However there are some limitations due to the fact that git-svn cannot 
   commit as multiple authors (unless all of them provided their passwords
   to Victor, yet he doesn't want to take over the world.)
   This means that if a commit is pushed to vic/buildr/master and has not
   already been pushed by YOU to Apache's SVN by using `git apache-push` 
   your change will be commited to apache/trunk having Victor as the author
   (that's how he gains meritocratic points at Apache :P). 

   So, it's very important - if you care about meritocracy - to follow or at 
   least that you get an idea of the recommended workflow.

RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW:
   
   So now that you have your local buildr copy you can create topic branches 
   to work on independent features, and still merge easily with head changes. 

   They may seem lots of things to consider, but it's all for Buildr's healt.
   As all things git, you can always follow your own workflow and even create
   aliases on you .git/config file to avoid typing much. So, here they are:

   1) get your buildr-git configured 
     (you have already do so, this was the most difficult part)

   2) create a topic branch to work on, say.. you want to add cool-feature:

        git checkout -b cool-feature master 
        # now on branch cool-feature

   3) hack hack hack.. use the source luke.
      every time you feel you have something important like added failing 
      spec, added part of feature, or resolved some conflict from merges,
      you can commit your current progress. If you want to be selective, use: 
      
        git commit --interactive

   3) review your changes, get ALL specs passing, repeat step 3 as needed

   4) let's see what are they doing on trunk

        git apache-fetch
        # You can inspect the upstream changes without having to merge them
        git log apache/trunk # what are they doing!!
      
   5) integrate mainstream changes to your cool-feature branch, you can always
      use `git cherry-pick` to select only some commits.

        git merge apache/trunk cool-feature
   
   6) Go to 3 unless ALL specs are passing.

   7.a) (Skip to 7.b you have commit bit on Apache's SVN)
      Create a patch using `git format-patch`
      Promote your changes, create a JIRA issue and upload it granting Apache
      license to include your code:

        https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BUILDR
        buildr-dev@incubator.apache.org

   7.b) Now you have everyhing on staging area and merged important changes 
      from apache/trunk, it's time to commit them to Apache's SVN.

        git apache-push 

   8) Optional. If you can push to vic/buildr/master mirror, you can just 
     synchronize the mirror helping others to get changes without having to 
     wait on Victor's cronjob to run every hour (useful for urgent changes).

        git synchronize

   9) Pull changes from origin frequently.
        
        git fetch origin
        git rebase --onto origin/master master master

   10) Unconditionally, Go to step 2 ;)
       Share your buildr-git workflow, git tips, etc.
